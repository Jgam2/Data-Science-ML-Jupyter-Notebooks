        "Here we will load data from file, filter it, and graph it. Doing so is a very important first step in order to build proper models, or to understand their limitations.\n",

        "As normal, in the examples below, there is no need to edit any code. Try to read it, understand it, then press the run button to run it. As always, it is vitally important that these code blocks are run in the correct order, and nothing is missed.\n",
